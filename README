These are all the materials for the SudoGlove Gesture Controller.
The SudoGlove was Developed by Jeremy E. Blum <www.jeremyblum.com>
More info on the SudoGlove is available at www.sudoglove.com

Belt Holster 3D Design:
These are the laser cutting vectorized files for the belt holster that holds and arduino mega, transceiver, battery, etc.

CODE:
This includes the arduino code that runs on the SudoGlove, and the arduino code that runs in the RC Car (proof of concept hardware)

Datasheets and Parts Info:
Some notable info on components used in the system design

Processing Display:
This is the source code for the processing display program that I used to debug the glove functionality

SudoSynth PD Patch:
This is the PUREDATA software patch and accompanying sound clips that allow you to use the sudoglove as a music synthesizer

car sounds:
The RC car that I controlled with the SudoGlove has a SOMO audio module for playing sound effects - These are the sound effects pre-converted to the 4-bit format.

schematics:
These are the schematics for both the RC car and the SudoGlove Controller
